**Wort chiller:**

After Boiling the wort, it needs to be cooled down to the fermentation temperature, in other words, lower or at equal temperature of fermentation temperature, usually around 19 degrees C for an ale.

The following wort chiller is tubular. It has a wide opening compared to a plate heat  exchanger making it easier to clean and less prone to clogg with remaining hop material. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d737b55f-2b8d-4521-8199-b470d691a964.png)
